<p>It was a Midsummer Night, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> in his
<i>sanctum</i> dreamed a Dream! To adapt the Laureate's lay:&mdash;</p>

<div class=" bold poem" style="width:20em;margin:auto;">
<div class="stanza">
<span>He read, before his eyelids dropt their shade,</span>
<span class="in1em">The <i>Lusiads</i> of <span class="smcap">Camoens</span>, long ago</span>
<span>Sung by the Lusitanian bard, who made</span>
<span class="in1em">Great <span class="smcap">Gama's</span> glories glow.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was the wondrous tale of <span class="smcap">Stanley</span> which had turned the Sage's
attention to the pages of the great Epic of Commerce.</p>

<p>He had read:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem bold" style="width:22em;margin:auto;">
<div class="stanza">
<span>"Afric behold! alas, what altered view!</span>
<span>Her lands uncultured, and her sons untrue;</span>
<span>Ungraced with all that sweetens human life,</span>
<span>Savage and fierce, they roam in brutal strife;</span>
<span>Eager they grasp the gifts which culture yields,</span>
<span>Yet naked roam their own neglected fields."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>And though even Africa has considerably changed since the year of grace
1497, when "daring <span class="smcap">Gama</span>" went "incessant labouring round the
stormy Cape," Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> thought of that great gloom-shrouded
Equatorial Forest and its secular savage dwarf-denizens, and mused how
much there was yet for our modern <span class="smcap">Gamas</span> to do in the Dark
Continent.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> found himself in the lovely "Isle of Venus," the
delicious floral Paradise which the Queen of Love, "the guardian goddess
of the Lusian race," created "amid the bosom of the watery waste," as "a
place of glad repast and sweet repose," for the tired home-returning
<span class="smcap">Gama</span> and his companions.</p>

<p>"Of 'glad repast,'" said a familiar voice, "there is plenty and to
spare; but for the 'sweet repose,' 'tis not to be found in this 'Isle of
Banqueting.'"</p>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, I presume?" said the Sage.</p>

<p>"You <i>cannot</i> presume," rejoined H. M. neatly. "But some of these
gregarious dinner-givers <i>do</i>, and sometimes,&mdash;yes, sometimes I'm
afraid I let them see that I'm aware of it."</p>

<p>"As fame-preoccupied, country-loving <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, wearied of the
'feasts, interludes, and chivalrous entertainments,' with which 'the
taste of that age demonstrated the joy of Portugal,' might perchance
have snubbed some too importunate Don. 'The compliments of the Court and
the shouts of the streets were irksome to him,' says the chronicle."</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> is not quite a Prince <span class="smcap">Henry</span> apparently,"
remarked the modern <span class="smcap">Gama</span>. "He and his father <span class="smcap">John</span> did
not find the discoveries and acquisitions of their heroic compatriot
'embarrassing.' 'The arts and valour of the Portuguese had now made a
great impression on the minds of the Africans. The King of
<span class="smcap">Congo</span>, a dominion of great extent, sent the sons of some of his
principal officers to be instructed in arts and religion.' This was four
hundred years ago! And now
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. iv]</span>
the Portuguese can be safely snubbed and sat upon, even by a
<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>! But if your prudent Premier doesn't 'stiffen his
back' a bit, with regard to the tougher and tentative Teuton, 'the arts
and valour' of the Britishers will not make as great an impression on
the minds of the Africans as your ill-used East African Company could
desire."</p>

<p>"Don't be <i>too</i> downhearted, <span class="smcap">Henry</span>," smiled the Sage.
"Much dining-out doth breed dyspepsia, and atrabilious views are apt to
be a <i>leetle</i> lop-sided."</p>

<p>"Right, <i>Mr. Punch!</i>" said a musical but somewhat mournful voice,
that of the great but ill-starred <span class="smcap">Luis de Camoens</span> himself. "I
wrote much of my <i>Lusiadas</i> in Africa.</p>

<p class="center"><b>"'One hand the pen, and one the sword employed.'</b></p>

<p>"<i>My</i> reward was banishment, imprisonment, poverty, neglect, and a
miserable death in an almshouse. 'Soon after, however,' says the record, 'many
epitaphs honoured his memory: the greatness of his merit was universally
confessed, and his <i>Lusiad</i> was translated into various languages.' 'The
whirligig of time brings its revenges,' as your own illustrious Singer saith.
How think you myself and my friend <span class="smcap">Vasco de Gama</span>
here look upon the fallen state of our beloved native land? In vain he ventured
for her. In vain I warningly sang:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width:20em; margin:auto;">
<div class="stanza">
<b>"'Chill'd by my nation's cold neglect, thy fires<br />
Glow bold no more, and all thy rage expires.<br />
Shall haughty Gaul or sterner Albion boast<br />
That all the Lusian fame in thee is lost!'"</b><br />
</div>
</div>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> bowed low to the illustrious Poet and the indomitable
Explorer. "Greatness," said he, courteously, "claims reverence, and
misfortune respect. Your countrymen, Gentlemen, have been rather angry
with me of late. But 'sterner Albion' may be proud indeed if she
produces such men as <span class="smcap">Gama</span> to perform heroic deeds, and such
poets as <span class="smcap">Camoens</span> to sing them." The stately Shades saluted. "I
wonder," said <span class="smcap">Gama</span>, "who will be the Laureate of the later
Ulysses, and which of your singers will write the <i>Epic of
Africa?</i>"</p>

<p>"I fear," said Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, "that at present they are too busy
smiting the Socialistic big drum, or tickling their sonorous native
tongue into tinkling triolets. In this Island of Venus&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I beg pardon," interrupted <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>, with a sardonic smile.
"This Island of <i>Menus</i>, you mean, Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>!"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span> looked around. The Acidalian roses and myrtles, the
purple lotos and the snowy thorn, the yellow pod-flowers and the waving
palms, the vermeil apples and the primrosed banks, of <span class="smcap">Camoens'</span>
somewhat zone-confounding vision, had indeed vanished, and in their
stead seemed to wave snowy <i>serviettes</i>, to flow champagne-streams,
to glitter goblets, and to glow orchid-laden <i>épergnes</i>.</p>

<p>"Humph!" said the Sage. "The prose of the <i>Restaurateur</i>&mdash;which by
the way sounds as if I were alluding to the literature of the
Restauration,&mdash;hath insensibly superseded the poesy of the peerless
Portuguese. Well, Gentlemen, in vain may 'sterner Albion' glory in the
profusion of wealth and the pomp of 'glad repast,' unless also she
breeds heroes to adventure and poets to celebrate. As you sang, my
<span class="smcap">Camoens</span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem bold" style="width:20em;margin:auto;" >
<div class="stanza">
"'The King or hero to the Muse unjust,<br />
Sinks as the nameless slave, extinct in dust.'
</div>
</div>

<p>"For the present, <span class="smcap">Stanley's</span> arm and Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch's</span> pen
suffice to save the State from such abasement. But let our timid
Premiers and our temporising Press remember the glories of <span class="smcap">Gama</span>
and <span class="smcap">Camoens</span>, and the fate of ungrateful and indolent
Lusitania!"</p>

<p>"The Pen of Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>!" cried <span class="smcap">Camoens</span>. "Ah, long have
the valiant <span class="smcap">Vasco</span> and myself desired to peruse its sparkling
and patriotic outpourings.".</p>

<p>"And you, my <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>," proceeded Mr. <span class="smcap">Punch</span>, "said to
the banqueting Fishmongers, 'I am an omnivorous reader whenever an
opportunity presents itself.' It presents itself here and now. Take,
Illustrious Trio, the greatest gift that even <span class="smcap">Punch</span> can bestow
upon you, to wit his</p>

<h2 class="sans">JOURNAL OF A ROLLING STONE.</h2>

<p class="smcap center">Fourth Entry.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> for a considerable time past been "eating dinners,"
preparatory to being "called" to the Bar. Understand now what people
mean when they talk of a "<i>Digest</i> of the Law."</p>

<p>Find myself (on dining for the first time this Term) in a mess with a
highly-intelligent native of India, another man up from Oxford, and an
African law-student. Latter black and curly, but good-natured. Says
there is a great demand for English-made barristers on the Gambia, and
he's going to supply the demand.</p>

<p>Have wild and momentary idea of going to the Gambia myself.</p>

<p>"Why," I ask this enterprising negro, "why don't English
barristers&mdash;white ones, I mean&mdash;go and practise there?" Feel that
reference to colour is not felicitous; still, difficult to express the
idea otherwise.</p>

<p>African doesn't mind. Shows all his teeth in a broad grin, and says,
"Inglis men die, die like flies, on the Gambia."</p>

<p>Curious to see the Hindoo law-student looking contemptuously at African
ditto. Hindoo a shrewd fellow. Talks English perfectly. Rather given to
gesticulate. Waves his arms, and incidentally knocks over a bottle of
the claret&mdash;at twelve shillings a dozen&mdash;which the Inn kindly supplies
to wash down the mutton and baked potatoes at our two-shilling meal.
Hindoo laughs. Tells me, confidentially, that he has practised as a
"Vakeel" (whatever that is) in some small country town in Bengal. Why
has he come over here? Oh, to be called. Will get more work and more
pay, when a full-fledged barrister. Gather that there are rival
"Vakeels" in Bengal whom he wants to cut out. He intends "cutting
out"&mdash;to India&mdash;directly he <i>is</i> called.</p>

<p>Oxford man tells me in a whisper that "he believes he's a Baboo."
Indeed! Don't feel much wiser for the information.</p>

<p>African getting jealous of Baboo's fluent talk. Rather a sportive negro,
it appears. Says he goes to theatre nearly every night. Has a regular
and rather festive programme for each day.</p>

<p>"Lecture, morning," he says; "afternoon, walk in Park, sometimes ride.
Night, theatre or music-hall." He grins like an amiable gargoyle. In his
own country African law-student must be quite a lady-killer&mdash;a sort of
Gambia masher.</p>

<p>Incidentally mention to Hindoo difficulty of law of Real Property,
especially "Rule in <span class="smcap">Shelley's</span> Case."</p>

<p>It seems Hindoo understands matter perfectly. Begins to explain the
"Rule in <span class="smcap">Shelley's</span> Case." Does it by aid of two salt-cellars
(to represent the parties) and a few knives (to represent collateral
relatives).</p>

<p>African masher more jealous. Laughs at Baboo's explanation. He and Baboo
exchange glances of hatred. African, who is carving, brandishes knife.
Is he going to plunge it into heart of Baboo just as he's got through
his explanation? Looks like it, as the shilling claret seems to have got
into place where we may suppose African's brain to be. However, dinner
ends without a catastrophe.</p>

<p>After attending the usual amount of legal lectures, the "Final" Exam.
approaches.</p>

<p>Get through the papers pretty well. Thank goodness, no question asked so
far about that "Rule in <span class="smcap">Shelley's</span> Case," which is my "<i>Pons
Asinorum</i>!" It's a "rule" to which I take great exception.</p>

<p>There's a "<i>Vivâ Voce</i>" to come, however. Hate <i>vivâ voce.</i>
Two examiners sit at end of Hall&mdash;students called up in batches of
half-a-dozen at a time. Very nervous work. Find, when my turn comes,
that the intelligent Baboo is in the same lot! Appears to like the
position. From his manner I should judge that he'd been doing nothing
all his life but being examined by fifties in a cave, like this.</p>

<p>Examiner who tackles me has an eye-glass.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. <span class="smcap">Joynson</span>," he remarks, putting it up to survey me
better, "if you were a trustee, &amp;c., &amp;c., <i>what would you do?</i>"</p>

<p>Flattered at the supposition. Answer in a way which seems to partly
satisfy Examiner, who passes on to next man with a new question. In a
minute or two my turn comes round again.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. <span class="smcap">Joynson</span>," Examiner again observes cheerfully, "let me
ask you quite an elementary question in Real Property. Just give me a
brief, a very brief, explanation of what you understand by the Rule in
<span class="smcap">Shelley's</span> Case!"</p>

<p>But I don't understand anything by it! It's a piece of hopeless legal
gibberish to me. I stammer out some attempt at an answer, and see Baboo
looking at me with a pitying, almost reproachful, glance. "Didn't I," he
seems to say, "explain it all to you once at dinner? Do you really mean
to say that you've forgotten the way in which I arranged the
salt-cellars and the table-knives, and how I turned the whole case
inside out for your benefit?"</p>

<p>I admit the offence. Examiner seems surprised at my ignorance&mdash;informs
me that "it's as easy as A.B.C." It may be&mdash;to him and the Baboo.</p>

<p>Baboo, being asked the same question, at once explains the whole matter,
this time without the aid of the salt-cellars and cutlery.</p>

<p>A few days later go to look at result of examination. Result, for me&mdash;a
Plough!</p>

<p>Walking away dejectedly&mdash;("homeward the Plough-man wends his legal
way"&mdash;as <span class="smcap">Gray</span> sympathetically put it)&mdash;meet African
law-student, who grins insanely. <i>He</i> doesn't sympathise in my
defeat. Shows his fine set of ivories and says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Me failed too. Me go back Gambia. You come back with me!"</p>

<p>Tell him I'm not "called" yet: certainly not called to Gambia.</p>

<p>"Then come to Alhambra!" he suggests, as a sort of alternative to a
visit to the tropics.</p>

<p>African student evidently still a masher. Decline his invitation with
thanks. Wouldn't be seen with him at a theatre for worlds! Depressed.
Don't even look in at Gaiety Bar. No Gaiety for <i>me</i>&mdash;and no "Bar"
either, it seems.</p>

<span>Somewhere in that unlovely street</span>

<span>Woke at the music of your feet,</span>

<h2>"JUST TO OBLIGE BENSON."</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;It was not a very happy thought to send me to
the Globe Theatre at this festive season of the year to witness the
representation of a piece, called by the management, for some reason or
other, "a <i>faërie</i> comedy." Now, I like a Burlesque, and I am fond
of a Pantomime, but a mixture of blank verse and tom-foolery is rather
too much for me, especially when that mixture is not redeemed by a plot
of any interest. Nothing can be more absurd than the story (save the
mark!) told in this particularly uninteresting play. It appears that a
"Duke!" of Athens married the Queen of the Amazons, and during the
nuptial rejoicings ordered the daughter of one of his subjects to "die
the death" unless she transferred her affections from her own true love
to a gentleman of her father's choice. The gentleman of her father's
choice was beloved in his turn by a school friend of his would-not-be
betrothed, and the play which lasted from eight until nearly midnight,
was devoted to setting this simple (in more senses than one)
<i>imbroglio</i> right. By a clumsy device, <i>Oberon</i> King of the
Fairies bewitched the two pairs of lovers during their sleep in a wood,
so that one lady had two admirers and the other none. All that was
needed to bring the piece to a conclusion was to have another exercise
of magic when the couples paired off, of course, in a manner calculated
to give satisfaction to their friends and relations. This was the entire
plot. There was now and again some attempts to turn amateur theatricals
into feeble ridicule by the introduction of a party of village
histrions, who were allowed to "clown" to their heart's content; and
<i>voilà tout</i>!</p>

<p>The mounting is excellent. Nothing better than "a Wood near Athens,"
painted by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hemsley</span>, has been seen since Professor
<span class="smcap">Herkomer</span> startled the world with his representation of village
life at Bushey. The music, too (chiefly from the works of
<span class="smcap">Mendelssohn</span>), is always charming, and frequently appropriate.
Moreover, Mr. <span class="smcap">Benson</span>, no doubt feeling that his author required
every possible support, has introduced a number of pretty dances,
executed by comely maidens of ages varying from seven to (say)
seven-and-twenty.</p>

<p>Of course, such a play required very ordinary acting. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Benson</span> was, on the whole, a gentlemanly <i>Lysander</i>, Mr.
<span class="smcap">Otho Stuart</span> a dignified <i>Oberon</i>, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Stephen
Phillips</span> quite the best of the village histrions. Miss <span class="smcap">Grace
Geraldine</span> was also fanciful in the <i>rôle</i> of a sort of gnome.
But, allowing for the music, and the scenery, and the acting, the piece
itself was unquestionably dull. And now, having given you my unbiassed
opinion, I beg to sign myself, <span class="smcap">Your Unprejudiced Contributor</span>.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I am told that the author of <i>A Midsummer's Dream</i> wrote a number of other plays
of considerable merit. This I challenge, the more especially as those who swear by
Mr. <span class="smcap">William Shakspeare</span> candidly admit that his name is a deterrent rather than an
attraction on a play-bill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Music-hall Dramatist, like <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>, has a right
to take his material from any source that may seem good to him. <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, therefore, makes no secret of the fact, that he has based the
following piece upon the well-known poem of "<i>The Purloiner</i>," by
the Sisters <span class="smcap">Jane</span> and <span class="smcap">Ann Taylor</span>, who were <i>not</i>,
as might be too hastily concluded, "Song and Dance Duettists," but two
estimable ladies, who composed "cautionary" verses for the young, and
whose works are a perfect mine of wealth for Moral Dramatists. In this
dramatic version the Author has tried to infuse something of the old
Greek sense of an overruling destiny, without detriment to prevailing
ideas of moral responsibility. Those who have the misfortune to be born
with a propensity for illicit jam, may learn from our Drama the terrible
results of failing to overcome it early in life.</p>

<p><i>Joe</i> (<i>tonelessly, as before</i>). Lady, I know you not (<i>touches lower

jam in all my veins, and I would fain sleep. When I am gone, lay
me in a plain white jelly-pot, with a parchment cover, and on the

<h2 class="sans">THE SAVOYARDS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Messrs. Gilbert and Sullivan's</span>
<i>Gondoliers</i> deserves to rank immediately after <i>The Mikado</i>
and <i>Pinafore</i> bracketed. The <i>mise-en-scène</i> is in every way
about as perfect as it is possible to be. Every writer of
<i>libretti</i>, every dramatist and every composer, must envy the Two
Savoyards, their rare opportunities of putting their own work on their
own stage, and being like the two Kings in this piece, jointly and
equally monarchs of all they survey, though, unlike these two
potentates, they are not their subjects' servants, and have only to
consider what is best for the success of their piece, and to have it
carried out, whatever it is, literally regardless of expense. And what
does their work amount to? Simply a Two-Act Opera, to play
two-hours-and-a-half, for the production of which they have practically
a whole year at their disposal. They can go as near commanding success
as is given to mortal dramatist and composer, and for any comparative
failure they can have no one to blame but themselves, the pair of
them.</p>

</a>
<p>"Once upon a time there were two Kings."</p>
</div>

<p>Whatever the piece may be, it is always a pleasure to see how
thoroughly the old hands at the Savoy enter into "the fun of the
thing," and, as in the case of Miss <span class="smcap">Jessie Bond</span> and Mr. <span class="smcap">Rutland
Barrington</span>, absolutely carry the audience with them by sheer
exuberance of spirits.</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Rutland Barrington</span> possesses a ready wit and keen appreciation
of humour; and, as this is true also of Miss <span class="smcap">Jessie Bond</span>,
the couple, being thoroughly in their element with such parts as
<i>The Gondoliers</i> provide for them, legitimately graft their own fun
on the plentiful stock already supplied by the author, and are literally
the life and soul of the piece.</p>

<p>On the night I was there a Miss <span class="smcap">Norah
Phyllis</span> took Miss <span class="smcap">Ulmar's</span> part
of <i>Gianetta</i>, and played it, at short notice, admirably. She
struck me as bearing a marked facial resemblance to Miss <span
class="smcap">Fortesque</span>, and is a decided acquisition.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Denny</span>, as the Grand Inquisitor (a part
that recalls the Lord High Chancellor of the ex-Savoyard, <span
class="smcap">George Grossmith</span>, now entertaining "on his
own hook"), doesn't seem to be a born Savoyard, <i>non nascitur</i> and
<i>non fit</i> at present. Good he is, of course, but there's no
spontaneity about him. However, for an eccentric comedian merely to do
exactly what he is told, and nothing more, yet to do that, little or
much, well, is a performance that would meet with <i>Hamlet's</i>
approbation, and Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilbert's</span>. Mr. <span
class="smcap">Frank Wyatt</span>, as "the new boy" at the Savoy
School, doesn't, as yet, seem quite happy; but it cannot be expected
that he should feel "quite at home," when he has only recently arrived
at a new school.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Brandram</span> is a thorough Savoyard;
<i>nihil tetigit quod non ornavit</i>, and her embroidery of a part
which it is fair to suppose was written to suit her, is done in her own
quaint and quiet fashion.</p>

<p>Rutland Pooh-Bah-rington, after signing his

<p>A fantastically and humorous peculiarly Gilbertian idea is the
comparison between a visit to the dentist's, and an interview with the
questioners by the rack, suggested by the Grand Inquisitor Don <span
class="smcap">Alhambra</span> who says that the nurse is waiting
in the torture-chamber, but that there is no hurry for him to go and
examine her, as she is all right and "has all the illustrated
papers."</p>

<p>There are ever so many good things in the Opera, but the best of all,
for genuinely humorous inspiration of words, music and acting, is the
quartette in the Second Act, "In a contemplative fashion." It is
excellent. Thank goodness, <i>encores</i> are disencouraged, except
where there can be "No possible sort of doubt, No possible doubt
whatever" (also a capital song in this piece) as to the unanimity of the
enthusiasm. There is nothing in the music that catches the ear on a
first hearing as did "<i>The Three Little Maids</i>," or "<i>I've got a
Song to Sing O!</i>" but it is all charming, and the masterly
orchestration in its fulness and variety is something that the least
technically educated can appreciate and enjoy. The piece is so brilliant
to eye and ear, that there is never a dull moment on the stage or off
it. It is just one of those simple <i>Bab-Ballady</i> stories which,
depending for its success not on any startling surprise in the plot, but
on general excellence, may, especially on account of the music, be
safely put down on the play-goer's list for "a second hearing."</p>

<h2>RUSSIAN ART.</h2>

<p>From <i>The Morning Post</i>, last week, we learn that the Russian
Imperial Academy of Arts, has passed a law prohibiting Jews to
become members of its artistic body. By the Nose of <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
but this is too bad, and too bigoted for any century, let alone the
"so-called Nineteenth." If such a rule, or rather such an exception,
could have been possible in England within the last twenty years,
what a discouragement it would have been for all the Royal Academicians,
who would thereby <i>have lost Hart!</i> Dear good old <span class="smcap">Solomon</span>!
He was a poor <span class="smcap">Hart</span> that often rejoiced, and if he was not
the best painter in the world, he was just about the worst punster.
We hope to hear that our Royal Academicians, with their large-hearted
and golden-tongued President at their head, will send a
friendly expostulation to their Russian Brothers in oil, and obtain
the abrogation of this unreasonable legislation, which is one effect
of an anti-semitic cyclone, fit only for the <i>Jew-ventus Mundi</i>, but
not for the world at its maturity.</p>

<h2>ANSWERS TO CORRESPONDENTS.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Preparing to meet an Epidemic.</span>&mdash;If you sit
all day in your great coat, muffled up to the eyes in a woollen
comforter and with your feet in constantly replenished mustard and hot
water, as you propose, you will certainly be prepared, when it makes its
appearance, to encounter the attack of the Russian Epidemic Influenza,
that you so much dread. Your idea of taking a dose of some advertised
Patent Medicine every other hour, as a preventive, is by no means a bad
one, and your resolution to shut yourself up in your house, see no
friends, open no letters, read no newspapers, and live entirely on
tinned meats for three months, might possibly secure you from the
chances of an attack; but on the whole we should rather advise you to
carry out your plan of leaving the country altogether and seeking a
temporary asylum in South Central Africa until you are assured that the
contagion has blown over, as the preferable one. Anyhow you might try
it. Meanwhile, certainly drench your clothes with disinfectants, fill
your hat with cotton wool steeped in spirits of camphor, and if you meet
any friends in the street, prevent them addressing you, by keeping them
at arm's-length with your walking-stick, or, better still, if you have
it with you, your opened umbrella. They may or they may not understand
your motive, and when they do, though they may not respect you for your
conduct, it is just possible that they may not seriously resent it. Your
precautionary measures, if scrupulously carried out, should certainly
ensure your safety. Put them in hand at once, and be sure you let us
hear from you next Spring informing us, on the whole, how you have got
on.</p>

<span>And now let us the memory of Christmas Cards and yarns bury</span>

<p>Once upon a time Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll</span> wrote a marvellously grotesque,
fantastic, and humorous book called <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>,
and on another occasion he wrote <i>Through the Looking-Glass</i>, in
which <i>Alice</i> reappeared, and then the spring of Mr. <span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll's</span>
fanciful humour apparently dried up, for he has done nothing
since worth mentioning in the same breath with his two first works;
and if his writings have been by comparison watery, unlike water,
they have never risen by inherent quality to their original level.
Of his latest book, called <i>Sylvie and Bruno</i>, I can make neither head
nor tale. It seems a muddle of all sorts, including a little bit of
Bible thrown in. It will be bought, because <span class="smcap">Lewis Carroll's</span> name
is to it, and it will be enjoyed for the sake of Mr. <span class="smcap">Furniss's</span> excellent
illustrations, but for no other reason, that I can see. I feel
inclined to carol to <span class="smcap">Carroll</span>, "O don't you remember sweet <span class="smcap">Alice</span>?"
and, if so, please be good enough to wake her up again, if you can.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">M. Fréderic Mayer's</span> International Almanack takes my breath
away. It is overwhelmingly international. Most useful to the
International Theatre-goer, as there are plans of all the principal
theatres in Europe, with the seats numbered, so that you have only
to wire (answer paid) to the Théâtre Français for <i>fauteuil d'orchestre</i>
Number 20, to Drury Lane in the same way, to the Operahaus, Berlin
("Open Haus" sounds so internationally hospitable) for <i>Parquet</i>
Number 200 (so as to get a good view), to the Wallner Theater, Berlin,
for something of the same sort, or to La Scala, Milan, for the sixth
<i>Sedie d'orchestra</i> on the left (as the numbers are not given&mdash;why?)
and you'll be accommodated. Then with ease the internationalist
can learn when the Moon is full, <i>Pleine Lune</i>, <i>Vollmond</i>, <i>Luna Piena</i>
and <i>Luna Ilena</i> in five languages. The Italian, the Spaniard, the
French, the Englishman, the German and the Dutchman can find
out all about the different watering-places of Europe, each one in
his own native tongue, and all about "the Court of Arches" in
London and Madrid. There is the Jewish and also the Mahommedan
Calendar, but I see nothing about the Greek Kalends. I am
not quite sure that the Bulgarians will be quite satisfied, and I
should say, that the Aborigines of Central Africa will have a distinct
grievance, which <span class="smcap">M. Fréderic Mayer</span> will rectify after an interview
with Mr. <span class="smcap">Stanley</span>. It's a wonderful production, and as it gives
postal rates and cab-fares in ever so many languages, it will be of
great practical value to the traveller. But no list of cab-fares is
perfect without a model row with the driver in eight languages,
including some bad language and directions as to the shortest route
to the nearest police court.</p>

<p>Our good Doctor <span class="smcap">Roose</span> <i>in urbe</i>, has just published a <i>brochure</i>,
dealing with the origin, treatment, and prevention (for there is
apparently no cure) of the fell disease to which, and for a multitude of
whose victims, Father <span class="smcap">Damien</span> died a martyr. If in the Doctor's treatment
of this subject after his own peculiar fashion <i>à la</i> <span class="smcap">Roose</span>, he can
help to alleviate present suffering and materially assist the crusade
now being undertaken against this common enemy, he will have
contributed his share of energy in starting 1890 hopefully.</p>

<p>Those who suffer from indigestion at this festive season, and wish
to intensify the effects of the malady, will do well to read a new
book entitled <i>Master of his Fate</i>, by <span class="smcap">J. MacLaren Cobban</span>, who, if
he does not write well, that is, judging his style from a hypercritical
purist's point of view, yet contrives to interest you with a story
almost as sensational as that of <i>Hyde and Jekyl</i>. The <i>Master of his
Fate</i> might have had for its second title, <i>Or, The Accomplished
Modern Vampire</i>, the hero being a sort of a vampire, but not one of
the good old school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scene.</span>&mdash;<i>The Theatre of the provincial town of Blankbury. A
company of Amateurs, the "Thespian Wanderers," are rehearsing

he drives down to it every morning in a private brougham, fitted
with a looking-glass, by the help of which he studies the air and
deportment characteristic of a modern Seneschal. He is a man
of few words, off as well as on the stage; but his eyes flash fury

Officer</i>), <span class="smcap">Gushby</span> (<i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Tom Tilbury</span>, <i>a comic Country Squire</i>),
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Dorothy Shuttle</span> (<i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Belinda</span>, <i>Nurserymaid in the family
of</i> Lord <i>and</i> Lady <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span>, <i>represented respectively by</i>
<span class="smcap">Boldero</span> <i>and</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Amelia</span>).
</p>

<p><i>Boldero</i> (<i>from the front of the house</i>). Stop a moment! You know
we really must settle what we are to do about those two children that
<i>Belinda's</i> got to wheel on in the double perambulator. I asked the
Duchess of <span class="smcap">Middlesex</span> to lend us her twins for a couple of nights,
but she writes to say they've just got the measles. Isn't there any
one here who can help us? [<i>The three Ladies titter.</i></p>

<p><i>Gushby</i> (<i>in whose breast the leading part played by</i> <span class="smcap">Spinks</span> <i>still
rankles</i>). Why not let <span class="smcap">Spinks</span> do it? He's always wanting to
"double" parts, and here's a splendid chance for him.</p>

<p><i>Spinks</i> (<i>coldly</i>). That's <i>very</i> funny&mdash;really <i>very</i> funny, <span class="smcap">Gushby</span>.
It's a pity "Colonel <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>" (<i>alluding to his own rôle in the
comedy</i>) isn't a <i>clown's</i> part. I'd give it up to you right off, if it
was. Ha, ha! (<i>bitterly</i>).</p>

<p><i>Colonel Clumk</i>. There's a man in my old regiment who's got two
red-haired brats; but he wants ten shillings a night for 'em.</p>

<p><i>Boldero.</i> That's pretty stiff. However, I'll inspect them to-morrow.
Let's get on a bit now. Come, <span class="smcap">Spinks</span>!</p>

<p><i>Spinks.</i> Where were we? (<i>With an air of intense annoyance.</i>)
These constant interruptions put one off so. Oh, yes, I remember.
(<i>Resumes rehearsing the part of</i> "Colonel <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>.") "Nursemaid,
take those squalling infants away. I'm surprised at Lady <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span>
permitting them in the drawing-room. Wheel them away at
once&mdash;at once, I say; or I'll make curry-powder of the lot of you!"</p>

<p><i>Miss Dorothy Shuttle</i> (<i>as</i> "<span class="smcap">Belinda</span>"). "Well, I'm sure; I never
was so spoken to afore. (<i>To her imaginary children.</i>) Did the
horrid man scold them, then, pretty dears? (<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>.) You
a Colonel? You ain't fit to be a General in the Salvation Army.
Imperence!" [<i>Exit, wheeling an imaginary perambulator.</i></p>

<p><i>Boldero</i> (<i>enthusiastically</i>). Excellent! That couldn't have been
done better. When we get the perambulator and the babies, it's
bound to go. (Miss <span class="smcap">Dorothy Shuttle</span> <i>is much pleased, and foresees
several stalls being taken on the occasion of her next benefit.</i>) Now,
then (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Spinks</span>, <i>who thinks it a mistake that a Stage Manager should
stop to praise anybody, with one exception, of course, at rehearsal</i>),
<span class="smcap">Spinks</span>, hurry up a bit, hurry up!</p>

<p><i>Spinks.</i> My dear <span class="smcap">Boldero</span>, I'm perfectly ready to begin as soon
as ever the talking stops. I know my cues, I fancy; but it's quite
hopeless to get on if <i>everybody</i> wants to talk at the same moment.
(<i>Resumes his part as</i> "Colonel <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>," <i>shaking his fist at the
departing</i> <span class="smcap">Belinda</span>.) "Impertinent minx! (<i>Turns furiously on</i>
<span class="smcap">Gushby</span>, <i>who is on the stage in the character of</i> <span class="smcap">Tilbury</span>, <i>the comic</i>
<span class="pagenum">[Pg. 12]</span>
<i>Squire.</i>) And you, Sir, what in the name of fifty thousand jackasses,
do you mean by standing there grinning from ear to ear like a buck
nigger? But I'll not stand it any longer, Sir, not for a moment.
D'ye hear, you miserable turnip-faced bumpkin, d'ye hear?"
(<i>Carried away by histrionic enthusiasm</i>, <span class="smcap">Spinks</span> <i>brings his fist
down violently on the precise spot where a table ought to be, but
is not, standing. As a natural result, he hits himself with much
force on his leg. The others laugh, and the Ladies turn away giggling,
feeling that they ought to be sympathetic. The unfortunate</i> <span class="smcap">Spinks</span>
<i>hurts himself considerably, and is furious. Coming, as it were, right
out of the part, and being temporarily himself again, only in a rage,
he addresses the Stage Manager.</i>) Upon my soul, <span class="smcap">Boldero</span>, this is
perfectly infamous. How often have I begged you to get that table
placed there <i>at all costs</i>, and time after time you forget it. I know
what it is; you want to make me ridiculous. But you'll be d&mdash;&mdash;
(<i>suddenly remembers that ladies are present, and substitutes a milder
expletive</i>)&mdash;confoundedly sorry for yourself when you find I'm
too lame to act, and the whole of your precious piece will be
ruined. You'll none of you get notices worth twopence from the
critics. [<i>Limps up and down the Stage.</i></p>

<p><i>Miss Amelia Slimper</i> (<i>rather a novice, and anxious to make useful
acquaintances among the distinguished Amateurs&mdash;to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>,
<i>whispering</i>). Are they very keen about notices?</p>

<p><i>Miss Kitty</i> (<i>experienced in Amateurs</i>). Keen! I should think
they were. They talk about nothing else when it's over.</p>

<p><i>Boldero</i> (<i>peaceably</i>). Well, <span class="smcap">Spinks</span>, you know you smashed two
tables last week, and I thought we agreed to rehearse without one.
But I'll see it's there next time. Now then, <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>! Where's
<span class="smcap">Jarp</span>? This is his entrance. Where the deuce is he? (<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">Jarp</span> <i>as</i> "Mr. <span class="smcap">Binns</span>, <i>Butler to</i> Lord <span class="smcap">Shorthorn</span>"). Dear me, <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>,
what have you been up to?</p>

<p><i>Jarp</i> (<i>vexed</i>). What have I been up to? I'll tell you. I've been
learning my part, and it would be a good thing if everybody were to
follow my example, instead of talking all day.</p>

<p><i>Boldero.</i> <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>, don't be sarcastic. It doesn't suit you. Let's
see if you know your part, after all this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jarp</span> (<i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Binns</span>, <i>without moving a muscle</i>). "'Er Ladyship's compliments,
Colonel <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>, and she would like to see
you."</p>

<p><i>Spinks</i> (<i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Debenham</span>). "Very
well. Tell her I'll come."</p>

<p><i>Jarp</i> (<i>as</i> <span class="smcap">Binns</span>). "Yes,
Sir."</p>

<p>[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Jarp</span> <i>as</i> <span
class="smcap">Binns</span>, <i>but immediately becomes</i> <span
class="smcap">Jarp</span>, <i>and complains to the young Ladies
that these fellows never will rehearse properly. The
professional Ladies sympathise with him, and admit that it is
very provoking, and</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Amelia</span>
<i>takes the opportunity of expressing her confident opinion that
he</i>, <span class="smcap">Jarp</span>, <i>will play his part
admirably, and only wonders that he hasn't got more to do. Then
somehow the conversation wanders towards professional matters,
and the probability of</i> Miss <span
class="smcap">Amelia</span> <i>being engaged next season at a
fashionable London Theatre, &amp;c., &amp;c.</i> </p>

<p><i>Miss Dorothy</i> (<i>aside, in a whisper, to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>, <i>alluding to</i>
<span class="smcap">Jarp's</span> <i>recent exit</i>). Is that all he's
got to say?</p>

<p><i>Miss Kitty</i> (<i>in same tone to</i> Miss <span class="smcap">Dorothy</span>). Not quite. He says,
"'Er Ladyship is served!" in the next Act. A part like that takes
a deal of learning.</p>

<p>[<i>The rehearsal proceeds.</i> <span class="smcap">Spuffil</span>
<i>does wonders as "a young man about town";</i> Colonel <span
class="smcap">Clumk</span> <i>performs the part of a Country
Clergyman in a manner suggestive rather of a Drill-sergeant than
a Vicar.</i> <span class="smcap">Boldero</span> <i>having
praised</i> <span class="smcap">Spinks</span>, <i>is pronounced
by the latter to be unapproachable as</i> Lord <span
class="smcap">Shorthorn</span>. <i>In the Third Act</i>, <span
class="smcap">Hall</span> <i>sings his song about</i> "the Boy
in Buttons." <i>On the previous day, he had had a difference with</i>
<span class="smcap">Spinks</span> <i>and</i> <span
class="smcap">Boldero</span>. </p>

<p><i>Boldero.</i> I think that song's out of place. What say you, <span
class="smcap">Spinks</span>?</p>

<p><i>Spinks.</i> Well, it does sound just a trifle vulgar.</p>

<p><i>Boldero.</i> Yes. I think we shall have to cut it, <span class="smcap">Hall</span>. It'll do
for next year just as well. You can make it fit any piece?</p>

<p><i>Hall</i> (<i>pale, but determined</i>). If that song goes, I go too. Oh, yes,
<span class="smcap">Spinks</span>, it's all very well for you to be so blessed polite to <span class="smcap">Boldero</span>,
but you didn't seem to think much of his acting (<i>observes</i> <span class="smcap">Spuffil</span>
<i>smiling</i>) no, nor of <span class="smcap">Spuffil's</span> either, when you spoke to me yesterday:
and as for <span class="smcap">Gushby</span>, why we all know what <span
class="smcap">Gushby</span> is.</p>

<p class="ralign"> [<i>All join in the fight, which continues for ten minutes.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Boldero</i> (<i>looking at his watch</i>). Good heavens! we shall miss our
train, and I've promised to look in on <span class="smcap">Irving</span> to-night. He'd never
forgive me if I didn't turn up.</p>

<p>
[<i>Smiles of quiet intelligence appear on the faces of the other
Amateurs, accompanied with a few winks, which like
"laughter in Court," are "immediately suppressed."
Exeunt omnes, severally, each pleased with himself, and
more or less disgusted with everybody else.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Miss Amelia</i> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Kitty</span>). What a funny lot! Are they like that
every year?</p>

<p><i>Miss Kitty.</i> Yes, always. But (<i>confidentially</i>) they do come out
strong for a "ben."</p>

<p>Surely <span class="smcap">Augustus Druriolanus</span> has triumphed and beaten the
record! For the last nine years it has been the cry, "There never
was so good a Pantomime as <i>this</i> one," and now again the shout is
repeated. <i>Jack and the Beanstalk</i> is the eleventh of the series, and
the best. "How it is done?" only <span class="smcap">Augustus</span> can answer. The
Annual (no longer, alas! written by the gentle and genial E. L. B.)
has an excellent book. It contains something of all sorts. Now
we have <span class="smcap">Shakspeare's</span> fairy-land with <i>Oberon</i>, <i>Titania</i>, and <i>Puck</i>,
then <span class="smcap">Harry Nicholl's</span> Royal Palace with Mr. <span class="smcap">Herbert Campbell</span>
and Miss <span class="smcap">Harriet Vernon</span>, then Madame <span class="smcap">Katti Lanner's</span> Market
Place, with a number of the most promising of her pupils (of all ages
too, from the tiny child to the "ceased-growing-a-long-while-ago")
then Mrs. <span class="smcap">Simpson's</span> Back Garden, with Mr. <span class="smcap">George Conquest</span> junior
as a giant, Mr. <span class="smcap">Dan Leno</span> as a widow, and the Brothers <span class="smcap">Griffiths</span>
as the Cow Company Limited, and lastly, controlling the whole, we
have Mr. <span class="smcap">Augustus Harris</span> who is seen at his very best when we
reach the Giant's Library and the realms of Olympus.</p>

<p>And this Pantomime is not only beautiful but amusing. It has
two grand processions, but this year, by good stage-management,
neither is tedious. The Shakspearean Heroines do a little play-acting
between whiles, and the gods and goddesses, or rather their
attendants, man&#339;uvre before the eye becomes weary of watching
their approach. For instance, Mars has scarcely time to swagger
down to the foot-lights in the most appropriate and approved fashion,
before he finds himself called upon to stand near a private box on
the prompt side, to be well out of the way of his dancing terpsichorean
satellites. <i>Lady Macbeth</i> has hardly "taken the daggers" before
<i>King Lear</i> (Mr. <span class="smcap">Lorraine</span>) is bringing a furtive tear to the eyes of
all beholders (<i>one</i> tear is sufficient at Christmastide) by his touching
pantomime in the presence of his three fair daughters.</p>

<p>Then, too, Mr. <span class="smcap">Harry Payne</span> has <i>his</i>
chance, and makes the most of it. It was quite pleasant to see the Clown
on Boxing-Night, and those who left the theatre mindful of trains that
will not delay the hours fixed for their departure, must have determined
(if they were wise people) to come again to witness the remainder of the
performances. Then those who liked acrobats had the Leopold Troupe, and
a strong man who lifted up a horse (but did not have his own name, or
the name of his charger, on the programme) to delight them. And it was
also a pleasing reflection to remember that the entertainment was the
result of solid hard work, combined with excellent judgment and taste.
Paterfamilias could say to Young Hopeful home for the holidays, "See
here, my lad, the lessee of our National Theatre could never have caused
us so much thorough enjoyment had he not worked with a will that you
will do well to imitate when you return to Dr. <span
class="smcap">Swishtales'</span> Academy at the conclusion of
the Christmas vacation." And so all can cry with genuine
enthusiasm:&mdash;"<i>Ave</i>, <span class="smcap">Augustus</span>!
<i>Ave</i>, <span class="smcap">Druriolanus</span>! <i>Ave</i>, <span
class="smcap">Imperator</span>! <i>Ave! Ave!</i>&mdash;and <span
class="smcap">Nicholls</span>."</p>
